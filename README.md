# Quantum-stuff

*This repo is mainly going to be some scenarios in quantum physics that I find fascinating*

infinite_potential_well.py is a program for the infinite potential well problem in quantum physics. Although this might be a really simple problem
it can form the basis for understanding a lot of quantum phenomena.

finite_potential_well.py is a program for the more realistic case of a finite potential well which has practical applications in nanostructures and 
devices like the quantum well laser

More stuff coming up, hopefully soon
